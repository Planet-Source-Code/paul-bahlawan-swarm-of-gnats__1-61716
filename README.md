### Description

This is a swarm of gnats flying around trying to catch the loan female. I guess it's like 300 heat seeking missiles! This was actually inspired by the snow falling programs posted on PSC last winter. [UPDATE MARCH 2010] Re-worked the math to use ATAN2 - makes it much simpler, added mouse button functionality (cool patterns y'all). Should be easy to adapt to your game that needs a heat-seeking missile or 300.
